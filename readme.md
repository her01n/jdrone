jdrone is a printable model for a quadcopter frame.
The model is designed programatically using
[jscad](https://github.com/jscad/OpenJSCAD.org) library.

The parts are designed to be easy to print.
No support is necessary, bridges and overhangs are kept short.
The build plate of 120x120 mm is necesary.
I recommend to print the parts with ABS.

The quadcopter is measured about 257mm diagonally,
and can handle propellers with 180mm diameter.
The motors are attached by 16*16mm M3 screws.
Flight controller is installed in 30.5x30.5 mm mounting, installing the stack is possible.
Receiver with dimensions 16x11mm can be added.

## Compile

Install *node*, *make* and *@jscad/cli* package, example for arch:

```
sudo pacman -Syu --needed npm make
sudo npm install -g @jscad/cli
```

Now you can run *make* to generate *stl* files.

```
make
```
